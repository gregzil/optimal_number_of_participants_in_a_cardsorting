# optimal_number_of_participants_in_a_cardsorting

We (Zilidis Grigorios & Pechlevanoudis Christos) are two post-graduate students at the Computer Science department of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. 
Currently, we are working on a study to complete our thesis. Our research focuses on Card Sorting and its title is:

"Minimum number of participants for collection of reliable data from card sorting experiments"

The main purpose is to conduct a sufficient number of studies, with about 150 participants, on two travel and e-shop sites respectively, that we have chosen and after at least two type of comparisons, to specify the minimum number of participants that will give us reliable data.
In our first analysis we conducted a Mantel test. 
For our second analysis, we used Element-centric Similarity comparison method.

Then the Python (Spyder) prints the correlations for these 2 methods and the error bars for the desirable participant range of our choice.

 We are two post-graduate students of the Computer Science department of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. Currently, we are working on a study to complete our thesis. Our research focuses on Card Sorting, which supports the process of designing and / or evaluating information architecture sites and its title is:

"Minimum number of participants for collecting reliable data from card-sorting studies"

 The main purpose is to conduct a sufficient number of studies, with about 150 participants, on two travel and two e-shop sites respectively, that we have chosen and after at least two type of comparison methods, to specify the minimum number of participants that will give us reliable data:
 
- In our first analysis we conducted a Mantel test. 
- For our second analysis, we used Element-centric Similarity comparison method.

  Then the Python (Spyder) prints the correlations and the error bars for these 2 methods, 
 by using the desirable participant range of our choice.
